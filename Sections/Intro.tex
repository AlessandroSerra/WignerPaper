The paper is organized as follows: first a brief and general
introduction on the GLE is given, focusing on the frequency-
dependent coupling between the thermostat and the system;
then a first case study, namely, liquid methanol, is presented
together with a detailed systematic analysis of technical aspects
of the thermostat; finally, we report a second application on
liquid water in order to highlight the portability of the method
and the physical diﬀerences between the two systems.
